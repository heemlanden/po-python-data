If you hit a tennis ball with a racket, a wave has to travel from the strings to your hand before you feel it - and the ball is well on its way to the net by this time. If you hit a golf ball, the ball is well on its way to the hole before you can feel it. Rigid bodies aren't truly rigid and understanding this is essential to understanding the way the world works",

Check out http://kiwico.com/Veritasium50 for 50% off your first month of any subscription!\n\nOn Thursday February 18th, 2021 the NASA Perseverance Rover will land on Mars. It is a wonderful robot, made out of steel and wire \u2014 but will future robots look like Perseverance? There is an emerging field of  research on \"soft robots\", where the machines are flexible. These soft robots have many advantages over traditional robots \u2014 they're safer, lighter, more flexible and can change their shape and size.\n\nNASA is investigating the use of soft robots for space missions. For future visits to Enceladus or Europa, a lander could cut a hole in the ice and then insert a compliant robot through the hole. This robot could then grow and change shape on the other side.\n\nReferences:\nN. S. Usevitch, Z. M. Hammond, M. Schwager, A. M. Okamura, E. W. Hawkes, S.

Learn more about Search here: https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/\n\nSpecial thanks to J.M.E.H van Bronswijk, author of 'House Dust Biology'. We exchanged emails to make sure I got my facts straight for this video. Below is an excerpt from her email to me, responding to my claims that start with a dash:\n\n- Around half of airborne dust particles under 100um are skin scales\nThis is true for climates, regions and seasons where people live mostly indoors.\nThe 1 to 2 g of skin scales shed each 24 hours will end up in places where people are present (and rub their skin or have textile moving over the skin).\nYou can also look at it from a different angle: What else has the same size and could contribute? That will usually be pollen from outdoor sources, also depending on season, region and climate, as well as the ventilation regime of the building.\nHowever, taken as the median value over a whole year, I consider your statement correct for regions with a temperate climate.\n\n- 53% of dust particles vacuumed from a mattress were found to be skin scales\nIt depends a little on the type of mattress. For polyether mattresses the amount may even be larger.\nFor mattresses made of natural material it could be less since the mattress-material will also give off small particles.\n\n- larger particles consist mostly of fibers, eg. cotton, paper, wool, synthetics\nThat's true .. including bread crumbs ..... \ud83d\ude42\n\n- skin scales seem to form a larger fraction of dust where we spend more time, e.g. in or near bed.\n..... and on the couch used to view television or be active in gaming.\nIt has to do with the constant production of skin scales over the 24 hours.\n\n- skin scales form a smaller fraction of dust if there are significant other sources, e.g. carpeting, dirt from outside etc.\nYes, everyting you walk on with your shoes or that recieves dirt from the outside with other means, will have a lessr percentage of human skin scales.\nHowever, do not forget the skin scales of pets that will also be an active allergen for many people, and a food source for house dust mites.\n\nInformation on dust particle size \u00a9ISO.

Purchase Cottonelle Flushable Wipes and try them for yourself: https://bit.ly/2WJm9Hq\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nProf. Beverley McKeon and team https://www.mckeon.caltech.edu\nDestin from Smarter Every Day https://www.youtube.com/smartereveryday\nNicole Sharp from FYFD https://ve42.co/fyfd\nPavol Dobryakov turbulent simulations: https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/\n\nI got into turbulent flow via chaos. The transition to turbulence sometimes involves a period doubling. Turbulence itself is chaotic motion, it is unpredictable and sensitively dependent on initial conditions. What surprised me is all the ways turbulent flow is useful to us. It is diffusive, meaning it causes mixing. This is useful in jet engines or rocket nozzles (which Destin studies) and is important to achieve in microfluidic devices, which are so small that turbulent flow is actually difficult to achieve. Turbulent flow can energize a boundary layer, which is important to maintain flow attachment over a wing, maintaining lift and delaying stall. Similarly a turbulent boundary layer over a golf ball reduces pressure drag allowing golf balls to fly further. This is the reason for the dimples on golf balls. Flow transitioning to turbulence in the wake of a bluff body can create periodic vortex shedding. This beautiful phenomenon can be seen in the von K\u00e0rm\u00e0n vortex street in clouds viewed from space. Turbulence is everywhere, in the air currents in a room, in your aorta, in the breaths you exhale, in oil pipelines and water pipes, in the flow over cars and ships and planes. Animals have evolved for it (like dead fish swimming up stream) and we have engineered our environment, our planes and golf balls for it. Laminar flow may be nice to look at (which is why we use it in decorative fountains) but turbulent flow does the real lifting.\n\nAnimations by:\nJonny Hyman (Sun, Jupiter, Reynolds, airfoil, Earth time-lapse)\n\nResearch and writing:\nAJ Fillo and Derek Muller.

Get up to 60% off the first year (annually billed) here: https://bit.ly/32SM0yd or use promo code VERITASIUM\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nProf. Sean Carroll https://www.preposterousuniverse.com\nHis book, a major source for this video is 'Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and The Emergence of Spacetime'\n\nCode for solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation by Jonny Hyman available here: https://github.com/jonnyhyman/QuantumWaves\n\nI learned quantum mechanics the traditional 'Copenhagen Interpretation' way. We can use the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schr\u00f6dinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.\n\nIn the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.\n\nSchrodinger's cat animation by Ivy Tello\nWave functions, double slit and entanglement animation by Jonny Hyman\nFilming of opening sequence by Casey Rentz\n\nSpecial thanks to Mithuna Y, Raquel Nuno and Dianna Cowern for feedback on the script\n\nMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"Experimental 1\" \"Serene Story 2\" \"Seaweed\" \"Colorful Animation 4\"",

        "description": "Scientists like Prof Sinclair have evidence of speeding up, slowing, and even reversing aging. \nThanks to LastPass for sponsoring this video. Click here to start using LastPass: https://ve42.co/VeLP\n\nWhat causes aging? According to Professor David Sinclair, it is a loss of information in our epigenome, the system of proteins like histones and chemical markers like methylation that turn on and off genes. Epigenetics allow different cell types to perform their specific functions - they are what differentiate a brain cell from a skin cell. Our DNA is constantly getting broken, by cosmic rays, UV radiation, free radicals, x-rays and regular cell division etc. When our cells repair that damage, the epigenome is not perfectly reset. And hence over time, noise accumulates in our epigenome. Our cells no longer perform their functions well. \n\nTo counter this decline, we can activate the body's own defenses against aging by stressing the body. Eat less, eat less protein, engage in intense exercise, experience uncomfortable cold. When the body senses existential threats it triggers longevity genes, which attempt to maintain the body to ensure its survival until good times return. This may be the evolutionary legacy of early bacteria, which established these two modes of living (repair and protect vs grow and reproduce). Scientists are uncovering ways to mimic stresses on the body without the discomfort of fasting. Molecules like NMN also trigger sirtuins to monitor and repair the epigenome. This may slow aging.\n\nReversing aging requires an epigenetic reset, which may be possible using Yamanaka factors. These four factors can revert an adult cell into a pluripotent stem cell. Prof. Sinclair used three of the four factors to reverse aging in the retinal cells of old mice. He found they could see again after the treatment.\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nProfessor David Sinclair, check out his book \"Lifespan: Why We Age & Why We Don't Have To\"\nAssistant Professor David Gold\nNoemie Sierra (for polyp images)\nGenepool Productions for telomere animations from Immortal: https://ve42.co/immortal\nEpigenetics animations (DNA, histones, methylation etc) courtesy of: http://wehi.tv\nAnimation: Etsuko Uno\nArt and Technical Direction: Drew Berry\nSound Design: Francois Tetaz & Emma Bortignon\nScientific Consultation: Marnie Blewitt\nCourtesy of Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research\n\nFilming, editing and animation by Jonny Hyman and Derek Muller\n\nMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"Clearer Views\" \"Innovations\" \"A Sound Foundation\" \"Seaweed\"\nAdditional music by Kevin MacLeod from https://incompetech.com \"Marty Gots a Plan\"",

I hope this video gives an idea of phase space - a picture of dynamical systems in which each point completely represents the state of the system. For a pendulum, phase space is only 2-dimensional and you can get orbits (in the case of an undamped pendulum) or an inward spiral (in the case of a pendulum with friction). For the Lorenz equations we need three dimensions to show the phase space. The attractor you find for these equations is said to be strange and chaotic because there is no loop, only infinite curves that never intersect. This explains why the motion is so unpredictable - two different initial conditions that are very close together can end up arbitrarily far apart.\n\nMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"The Longest Rest\" \"A Sound Foundation\" \"Seaweed\"",

But upon closer consideration there are a lot of reasons methods developed for paper folding are also applicable to engineering: origami allows you to take a flat sheet of material and convert it to almost any shape only by folding. Plus for large flat structures, origami provides a way of shrinking dimensions while ensuring simply deployment - this is particularly useful for solar arrays in space applications. Furthermore, motions designed to take advantage of the flexibility of paper can also be used to form compliant mechanisms for engineering like the kaleidocycle. Since the principles of origami are scalable, mechanisms can also be dramatically miniaturized.\n\nSome of the work shown is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under Grant No. EFRI-ODISSEI-1240417.

In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.\n\nBecause of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change.",

What evidence supports the existence of such a strange object at the edge of our solar system?\n\nHuge thanks to:\nProf. Konstantin Batygin, Caltech\nProf. David Jewitt, UCLA\n\nI had heard about Planet 9 for a long time but I wondered what sort of evidence could support the bold claim: a planet at the very limits of our ability to detect one, so far out that its period is over 60 times that of Neptune. The planet 9 hypothesis helps explain clustering of orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects. It also explains how some of these objects have highly inclined orbits - up to 90 degrees relative to the plane of the solar system. Some are orbiting in reverse. Plus their orbits are removed from the orbit of Neptune, the logical option for a body that could have ejected them out so far. The fact that the perihelion is so far out suggests another source of gravity was essential for their peculiar orbits.\n\nSpecial Thanks to Patreon Supporters:\nAlfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Bryan Baker, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, DALE HORNE, Donal Botkin, Eric Velazquez, halyoav, James Knight, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Kevin Beavers, kkm, Leah Howard, Lyvann Ferrusca, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Noel Braganza, Pindex, Ron Neal, Sam Lutfi, Stan Presolski, Tige Thorman\n\nMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Observations - From Now On\" \"Magnified XY\"",

Order one here: https://starbucks.app.link/derekmuller\n\nMaking liquid nitrogen is hard - in fact up until 150 years ago scientists doubted whether it was even possible to liquefy nitrogen. In 1823, At the royal institution in London, Michael Faraday first produced liquid chlorine, kind of accidentally by putting it under high pressure. He similarly liquefied ammonia.\n\nBorrowing a mixture from Thilorier in France, a combination of dry ice, snow and ether, he reached a temperature of -110C. By 1845 he used this mixture plus a hand pump to pressurize gases to liquefy all the known gases except six, which included oxygen and nitrogen. These became known as the \u201cpermanent\u201d gases.\n\nA French Physicist Aim\u00e9 compressed oxygen and nitrogen in tanks and then lowered them into the ocean over 1.6km deep, where the pressure got up to 200 atmospheres. Still the gases didn\u2019t liquefy.\n\nOnly at the end of 1877 were the first droplets of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen produced, by Cailletet in France. He first tried oxygen by compressing it up to 300 atmospheres, cooled to -30C, but that wasn't even enough to liquefy oxygen. But when he suddenly released the pressure, the expanding gas cooled, he estimated to -200C and he saw a mist and then droplets slide down the walls of his vessel.\n\nIt's amazing how far we've come in that now I can purchase a helium-based cryocooler. It compresses and expands the gas to absorb heat from the tip of the cold finger and eject it into the surroundings at ambient temperature.",

I think electric cars are the future, not mainly because they're better for the environment (which they are if you drive the car for any reasonable length of time) but because they are just better cars. The have better torque and acceleration, better handling, they're more efficient, quieter, they don't smell, they're cheaper to run and best of all you never have to visit a gas station - this appeals to me. I never have to worry about being low on gas because every morning my car is charged and ready to go - just like my phone and laptop. And if you're worried about range, don't. Almost all trips can already be done in an electric car with modest battery pack. And fast chargers along the way make it possible to do longer road trips if necessary. You have to make rest stops anyway, just time them with the charging. And consider that battery tech is getting dramatically cheaper, smaller, lighter.

It was only after studying nuclear bomb craters and the minerals found there that geologists concluded the energy and pressures that created Barringer Crater were too high to be from volcanic activity and therefore must have formed from a meteorite impact.\n\nSpecial Thanks to:\nNevada National Security Site\nThe National Atomic Testing Museum\nJonny Hyman and Verse: https://youtu.be/7bUUGzi-AAY\nActive Galactic for footage of craters in Arizona: https://youtu.be/yhoooBpndog\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\na human, Alfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Brent Stewart, Bryan Baker, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, Clip Tree, Coale Shifflett, Colin Bellmore, DALE HORNE, Daniel Milum, Donal Botkin, Eric Velazquez, Illya Nayshevsky, James Knight, James Wong, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Johnny, June Kang, Kevin Beavers, kkm, Leah Howard, Listen Money Matters, Lyvann Ferrusca, Manuel Z\u00fcrcher, Mathias G\u00f6ransson, Michael Bradley Wirz, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, OddJosh, Philipp Volgger, Pindex, Roberto Rezende, Robin DeBank, Ron Neal, Sam Lutfi, Stan Presolski, Tige Thorman, Warrior8252\n\nFilmed by Raquel Nuno\nStory and Editing by Derek Muller and Jonny Hyman\nMusic and Animation by Jonny Hyman\nProduced by Casey Rentz",

The footage is amazing! https://www.flir.com\n\nAerogel\u2019s extraordinary properties are due in large part to its structure. Aerogel is a solid but on the nanoscale it has a mesh or sponge-like structure. The struts of this structure are nanoscale, as are the pores at around 20nm across. This makes silica aerogel incredibly light (it was once the lightest solid but has now been superseded by graphene aerogel), transparent and adsorbent. \n\nAn ice-cube sized piece of aerogel has an internal surface area roughly equal to half a football field. Aerogel is used in high end museum cases to regulate humidity. Plus it helps maintain the vacuum on the Mars Insight seismometers - it adsorbs moisture and other outgassed volatiles that come from the spacecraft itself. Proposed uses include as a physical insecticide by \u2018drying out insects\u2019 reducing the need for chemical and toxic pesticides.\n\nSpecial thanks to all my Patreon supporters especially those who contributed feedback to an earlier draft of this video:\na human, Albert Jachowicz-Brzezi\u0144ski, Alfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Brent Stewart, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, Clip Tree, Coale Shifflett, Colin Bellmore, DALE HORNE, Eric Velazquez, Fedor Indutny, Fran Rodriguez, James Wong, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Johnny, Jorge Angel Sandoval, June Kang, Kevin Beavers, Kishore Tipirneni, Levan Ferr, Listen Money Matters, Manuel Z\u00fcrcher, Mark Bevilacqua, Mathias G\u00f6ransson, Michael Bradley Wirz, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Nicholas Hastings, OddJosh, Patrick \u010calija, Peter Tajti, Philipp Volgger, Roberto Rezende, Robin DeBank, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Swante Scholz, Tiago Bruno, Tige Thorman, Warrior8252\n\nFilmed by Paul Gramaglia\n\nThumbnail by Ignat Berbeci\n\nAnimations by Catherine Chooljian\n\nMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \u201cTonic Zone\u201d \u201cBetelgeuse\u201d \u201cInsidious Mice\u201d \u201cSeaweed\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not that serious\u201d \u201cPlatin00m - Sum It\u201d\n\nThis is an educational, scientific video.",

They appear to act like a non-Newtonian fluid: rigid under high shear stress, but they flow like a liquid under low shear.\nAll the signed shade balls have now been mailed out - thanks for your support!\n\nReceiving a shade ball:\n1. Support Veritasium on any Patreon tier and enter your address https://ve42.co/patreon\n2. In about a month I will send out signed shade balls\n3. I will cover all shipping costs but if things get really crazy I will prioritize existing Patreon supporters and higher tiers\n\nMy sense was that swimming in shade balls would be difficult but still doable. This was roughly true for the single layer of shade balls. The shade balls slide past each other so they act like a liquid, albeit a viscous one owing to their significant inertia. It's much more intense exercise and it's also annoying to be bombarded with shade balls on all sides of your body, particularly your head. With multi-layer shade balls (as exists on much of LA reservoir) things get significantly more difficult. The balls bunch together and when you try to move through them quickly, they become more rigid, providing significant resistance to motion. This has the benefit that you can lie on them and as long as they stay trapped under you, you can float on them. But a little bit of motion causes them to move around and you sink through quickly.\n\nHuge thanks to:\nJordan Schnabel and Cristian Carretero for filming and swimming and providing lifeguard services.\nRaquel Nuno for filming and putting up with me.\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nDonal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.\n\nMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"Dubstep Mammoth 2\" \"Finally Here (Instrumental)\" \"The Last Arrival\" \"Sundown Love (Instrumental)\"",

        "description": "I took a boat through 96 million black plastic balls on the Los Angeles reservoir to find out why they're there. The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.\n\nHuge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!\n\nThe balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nDonal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.\n\nThanks to:\nLas Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dump\nEuro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footage\n\nResearched and Produced by Casey Rentz\n\nAnimations by Maria Raykova\n\nMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Colorful Animation 4\" \"Seaweed\"\n\nAnd from Kevin MacLeod \"Marty Gots a Plan\"\n\nThis is an educational video about the science of water quality.",

It was great getting to meet all of you and learn about your original scientific research.\n\nSpecial thanks to Assistant Professor Konstantin Batygin for discussing Ana's research and Planet 9 with me. More is coming on the Planet 9 front.\n\nRonak came up with a new design for the phoropter, the device used to determine eye-glass prescriptions. It's basically been unchanged for 200 years. Using a liquid lens, he miniaturized the device and wrote an algorithm to determine your prescription.\n\nAna used math and physics to search for hidden exoplanets. There are a number of reasons why the transit method and Kepler telescope may have missed them: they're too small, too inclined, or take too long to orbit and so were not seen. By considering which planetary systems have additional space for more planets, Ana came up with 560 locations where we may look again for planets in future.\n\nAnjali developed an internet enabled device for measuring arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The device performs several chemical reactions to release the arsenic into a measurable state. It then reacts the arsenic with a test strip to produce a color output. This color is sampled by a camera and processed to determine the concentration of arsenic in the water sample. This has significant potential applications around the world helping reduce exposure to arsenic and potentially other contaminants.\n\nFilming by Raquel Nuno",

        "description": "We have just seen the first image of a black hole, the supermassive black hole in the galaxy M87 with a mass 6.5 billion times that of our sun. But what is that image really showing us?\n\nThis is an awesome paper on the topic by J.P. Luminet:\nImage of a spherical black hole with thin accretion disk\nAstronomy and Astrophysics, vol. 75, no. 1-2, May 1979, p. 228-235\nhttps://ve42.co/luminet\n\nUsing my every day intuition I wondered: will we see the \"shadow\" of the black hole even if we're looking edge on at the accretion disk? The answer is yes because the black hole warps space-time, so even if we wouldn't normally be able to see the back of the accretion disk, we can in this case because its light is bent up and over the black hole. Similarly we can see light from the bottom of the back of the accretion disk because it's bent under the bottom of the black hole. Plus there are additional images from light that does a half turn around the black hole leading to the inner rings.\n\nWhat about the black hole \"shadow\" itself? Well initially I thought it can't be an image of the event horizon because it's so much bigger (2.6 times bigger). But if you trace back the rays, you find that for every point in the shadow, there is a corresponding ray that traces back to the event horizon. So in fact from our one observing location, we see all sides of the event horizon simultaneously! In fact infinitely many of these images, accounting for the virtually infinite number of times a photon can orbit the black hole before falling in. The edge of the shadow is due to the photon sphere - the radius at which light goes around in closed orbits. If a light ray coming in at an oblique angle just skims the photon sphere and then travels on to our telescopes, that is the closest 'impact parameter' possible, and it occurs at sqrt(27)/2*r_s\n\nHuge thanks to:\nProf. Geraint Lewis \nUniversity of Sydney https://ve42.co/gfl\nLike him, I'm hoping (predicting?) we'll see some moving images of black holes tomorrow\n\nProf. Rana Adhikari\nCaltech https://ve42.co/Rana\n\nRiccardo Antonelli - for excellent images of black holes, simulations and ray-tracing code, check out:\nhttps://ve42.co/rantonels\n\nThe Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration\nCheck out their resources and get your local link for the livestream here: https://ve42.co/EHT\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nDonal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme\n\nFilming by Raquel Nuno\nAnimation by Maria Raykova",

I grew up with the two technologies (film and video) in parallel and to me they always seemed like two ways of achieving the same ends: recording and replaying moving images. But their histories are quite distinct. Film was always a way to capture moving images for later replaying. Video started out as a way to transfer images from one place to another instantaneously. This dates back to the first fax machine, mechanical TV, live broadcast tv and ultimately videotapes. This history focuses on the early decades of video and not the more recent switches to chip cameras and solid state storage. Maybe that's a story for another day.\n\nAdditional resources and references:\n\nThe Dawn of Tape: Transmission Device as Preservation Medium\nhttps://ve42.co/dawnoftape\n\nWhat Sparked Video Research in 1877?

Part count (reduced by having flexible parts instead of springs, hinges)\n2. Productions processes (many, new, different enabled by compliant designs)\n3. Price (reduced by fewer parts and different production processes)\n4. Precise Motion (no backlash, less wear, friction)\n5. Performance (no outgassing, doesn't require lubricant)\n6. Proportions (reduced through different production processes)\n7. Portability (lightweight due to simpler, reduced part count designs)\n8.

        "description": "Is it possible to reconstruct sound from high-speed video images?\nPart of this video was sponsored by LastPass: http://bit.ly/2SmRQkk\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Abe Davis for revisiting his research with me: http://abedavis.com\n\nThis video was based on research by Dr. Abe Davis and colleagues. I found out about this work years ago and was fascinated by the way he was able to capture vibration information in image-only video. I always imagined the motions of objects would be visible as when recording a tuning fork in slow motion - so deriving sound from high speed images seemed a feasible task. But the reality is much more difficult.\n\nSound vibrations only cause objects to wiggle by about a micrometer. This is much smaller than a pixel, so the algorithm must understand the characteristics of the image. A move in one direction should cause some pixels to lighten slightly, while others darken - and this behavior is correlated along the edges of the image. So noise can be reduced because it's random over the image and there are enough places to sample that you can get it to cancel out.\n\nSomething I'm wondering now is - would it be possible to capture sound in a single image? I'm thinking it would have to be an image of a large object or space because the wavelengths of typical sounds are quite long. Maybe a high frequency sound could be imaged in a suitable medium...\n\nAnimations by Alan Chamberlain\n\nMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Seaweed\"",

In extreme cases this has led to the practice of removing sections of the brain, or using electrodes or optical fibers to control activation rates.

Do you know how hard it is when you are thrust into low-gravity, like the 37% of Earth's gravity of Mars, and you have to remember what you were going to say in a 30 second window as blood floods your head? It's pretty hard. It would be even harder to actually travel to Mars. It would take about 8 months in microgravity during which time your muscles and bones would weaken substantially, even if you exercise for hours a day like the astronauts on the space station. And your heart is a muscle too so it weakens as well. Before I contemplated these rates of muscle and bone loss, I thought the major challenge with a round trip journey to Mars would be the logistics of spacecraft and having enough fuel to get back. But with the weakening of the human body, it's an open question whether anyone would really want to come back.\n\nFilmed by Steve Boxall\n\nMusic from Epidemic Sound: http://epidemicsound.com",

So what I learned really surprised me:\n\nThere are hundreds of scientists working on this shampoo. They run crazy-sounding experiments like hanging hair near Tokyo highways to understand how real-world environments deposit dirt on hair. They use sophisticated scientific techniques like electron microscopes, nuclear magnetic resonance and gene sequencing to study dandruff on the molecular level.\n\nIn fact they sequenced the entire genome of Malassezia globosa in 2002, one year after the human genome project. Their findings are published in international refereed journals. What they have found is that the Malassezia fungi create free fatty acids as byproducts of their digestion, which for some people create irritation and lead to hyper-proliferation of skin cells, flaking, histamines, inflammatory cytokines, and blood proteins reaching the surface of the skin. These findings indicate the unhealthiness of dandruff scalp and suggest a possible remedy - controlling the metabolism of the Malassezia fungi. This is achieved using different active ingredients in different products and different parts of the world, including zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, and piroctone olamine. With the reduction of irritants, the scalp actually expresses different genes, producing a signature more similar to a non-dandruff baseline scalp.\n\nMusic from Epidemic Sound: http://epidemicsound.com\nMusic also by Kevin MacLeod: http://incompetech.com",

I was curious about this because UV is technically non-ionizing. A photon of UV doesn't have enough energy to strip an electron off atoms or molecules. However it does have enough energy to trigger photo-chemical reactions. For example, it causes pyrimidine dimers - the unauthorized covalent bonding of adjacent thymine or cytosine bases in our DNA. If these spots are not properly repaired, they may lead to mutations and cancer. Photoaging is typically the result of degradation of collagen and elastin fibers - scaffolding that supports the skin. This leads to wrinkles and saggy-looking skin.\n\nHuge thanks to Patreon supporters:\nDonal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen, Yildiz Kabaran, Terrance Snow, Stan Presolski, James M Nicholson, KIMoFy\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nMusic from Epidemic Sound http://epidemicsound.com \"Serene Story 2\"",

Is it because of soil depletion, selective breeding, or... something else?\nWatch my new documentary, VITAMANIA: http://ve42.co/vita\n\nI came across this story as I was making the film Vitamania. When you ask sellers of vitamins why you should take vitamin supplements even if you eat a healthy diet, they will say because our food doesn't contain all the nutrients it once did. This is supposedly due to soil depletion, cold storage, food ripening off the vine, and global transport of out-of-season foods. And to an extent this is true. Foods contain the greatest amount of nutrients if they are eaten soon after they are harvested. An unexpected source of nutrient decline is the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It causes plants to grow faster and bulk up on carbs but at the expense of other nutrients, so in percentage terms the amount of nutrients are actually declining. For now this decline is modest so supplementing with vitamin pills is probably unnecessary for most people with a healthy diet but it may be a concern in future.\n\nThanks to Kate Pappas & Chris Kamen for writing, producing and filming this video with me\nEdited by Lucy McCallum\nSound mix by Wayne Hyett\nFact Checking by Calvin Lee and Claire Smith \nThanks to the Collingwood Children\u2019s Farm and Glenn Fitzgerald from the University of Melbourne & Agriculture Victoria\n\nFurther Reading: \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889157516302113\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15637215/?ncbi_mmode=std\nhttp://soils.wisc.edu/facstaff/barak/poster_gallery/minneapolis2000a/\nhttps://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/13/food-nutrients-carbon-dioxide-000511\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-24/scientists-warning-rice-may-become-less-nutritious/9792822",

Some pigments selectively absorb UV so they may appear white in the visible but dark in the UV. The pigments usually dissipate the UV energy as heat, though the breaking of bonds can also occur.\n2. Fluorescent molecules absorb UV light and re-radiate that energy as visible light. This makes them look dark in the UV but glowing under black light.\n3. Ultraviolet light scatters more than visible light because the wavelength is shorter and Raleigh scattering is proportional to the reciprocal of wavelength to the power of four.\n\nSpecial thanks to HHMI BioInteractive for their awesome animations of melanocytes and how the melanin in melanosomes protect your DNA.

I changed a lot of my preconceptions, specifically I thought:\n\n1. That the Earth's magnetic field was a passive thing - it shouldn't need a continuous input of energy to maintain itself (that seemed reasonable to me because the magnetic field has been around for a long time and it seems mostly stable). But as it turns out, the Earth is a giant electromagnet, and so of course those currents dissipate their energy as they encounter resistance in the liquid metal through which they flow. So the energy to continuously create these currents comes from the kinetic energy of the liquid metal flows in the Earth's outer core.\n\n2. If it's convection, I'm thinking hot things rising, cooler things falling. But apparently the main effect driving convection is the compositional differences at the boundary with the Earth's inner core. This is because of the differential freezing at the boundary. Things like iron freeze into the inner core, while elements like sulfur do not. Hence the pockets of lighter material which then rise outwards.\n\n3. I didn't get why the fluid motion was necessary for the generation of the magnetic field. I mean if it's a conducting liquid, it can conduct currents whether it moves or not. But the key is that the liquid metal can 'trap' magnetic fields. I imagine this like how iron channels magnetic fields. Then once these fields are channeled, they can be pulled and stretched, making more magnetic field.\n\n4. Fluids operate very differently in rotating frames of reference. This is something I didn't intuitively grasp. But, as fluids move from the inner core outwards, those particles are moving much more slowly in the direction of rotation than the matter that has been there for a long time, which means the convection currents get deflected and form helices.\n\nMusic by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com Brandenburg Concerto No4",

That's because we don't know what consciousness is, how it works, what's required to create it etc. So It might be technologically around the corner or a hundred years away.\n\nWhat I do think is more predictable is the development of autonomous weapons that use AI to be the most effective killing machines of all time. That is scary. As outline by people like Musk and Hawking, this threat is clear and present so we should address it.

Cars go fast, but they also sometimes collide with obstacles, which brings them to a sudden stop, subjecting the car and occupants to very high accelerations, which can cause injury or death. So the major idea to improve car safety is to reduce these accelerations and there are a number of ways to do this:\n\nPassive safety:\n\nSeat belts: keep passengers in the vehicle, preventing them from continuing with constant velocity, flying through the windshield and suffering a worse deceleration when they make contact with the road.\n\nCrumple zones: increase the distance over which deceleration occurs, thereby reducing peak magnitude of deceleration.\n\nAir bags: increase the distance over which the head decelerates, again reducing peak magnitude of deceleration of the head.\n\nActive Safety:\nAnti-lock braking system: rather than 'locking' the wheels as can happen if you slam on the brakes with a traditional braking system leading to the tires skidding across the road, ABS attempts to control the amount of braking so that the tires always roll with static friction in contact with the road. This increases the backward frictional force that can be applied to the tires, again increasing the distance over which deceleration occurs, and it gives the driver an opportunity to steer to avoid the collision (hence why it's referred to as an active safety system).\n\nSpecial thanks to Mercedes for having me visit facilities in Stuttgart. I had a lot of fun making these videos so please do check out the series on Mercedes Benz's channel: http://ve42.co/MB\n\nFilmed by Simon Schneider\nEdited by Hoplite Creative and Trevor Carlee",

Animation by Drew Berry at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. http://wehi.tv\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nJoshua Abenir, Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nEvery day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it\u2019s called programmed cell death.\n\nTo make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.\n\nAnd cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.\n\nThis is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.\n\nNow the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.\nIt literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.\nSo it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.\n\nTo prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.\nThese nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.\nYou can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.\n\nThe process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.\nAs simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let\u2019s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.\nThe kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it\u2019s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one\u2019s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.\nWhile the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide\nThe kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.\nAt this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long \u2018legs\u2019 so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.\n\nStudio filming by Raquel Nuno",

The mechanism is not the Bernoulli effect...\nWant to make this at home? https://youtu.be/BppcHF2EdAY\n\nMy friend Blake from InnoVinci emailed me with a cool idea for a video and footage of levitating balls in water streams. Initially it was tough to explain the physics of what was going on. The standard Bernoulli effect relies on the object being completely immersed in the upward-flowing fluid. But in this case the water seems to form a single stream around the object and it's deflected away and down from the stream. By Newton's third law, the force on the water by the ball is equal and opposite to the force of the water back on the ball, pushing it up into the stream. There is a stable equilibrium position because if the ball moves into the stream, it \"cuts off\" the water going over the ball so it drifts out. If it drifts out too far, then lots of water passes over the ball, pushing it back into the stream.\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon Supporters:\nTony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nFilmed by Raquel Nuno\nSlow motion by Hollywood Special Ops http://hollywoodspecialops.com\n\nMusic from Epidemic Sound http://epidemicsound.com \"Colored Spirals 3\" \"Magnified X 3\" \"In Orbit 2\" \"ExperiMental 1\"",

When you focus the sun's rays using a magnifying glass (or in this case sphere of water) you can increase the intensity roughly ten thousand fold. This increases the temperature of wood to its autoignition point starting the reaction with oxygen in the atmosphere.

Surely there's an accurate way to measure forces without creating such a huge known force?! Nope. This appears to be the best way, with a stack of 20 x 50,000 lb masses creating a maximum force of 4.45 MN or 1,000,000 pounds of force. I also wouldn't have thought about all the corrections that need applying - for example buoyancy subtracts about 125 pounds from the weight of the stack. Plus the local gravitational field strength must be taken into account. And, the gravitational field varies below grade. All of this must be taken into account in order to limit uncertainty to just five parts per million (.0005%)\n\nMusic from The Epidemic Sound http://epidemicsound.com \"Serene Story 2\"",

I didn't think we were going to get into the control room but we got lucky. Some of the greatest moments in the history of space exploration have taken place there. They have a giant vacuum chamber where they can take the rover down to the atmospheric pressure on Mars (roughly .01x Earth's atmosphere) and test all of the devices to make sure there are no electrical discharges due to the reduced pressure.

Apparently 80% of microgravity research can be performed in a zero-gravity plane, which is much cheaper than going to space. The flame from the lighter seemed much lazier in zero-g because without weight there is no buoyant force and therefore no convection.

It's also not clear exactly how this affects physiology or causes the sun sneeze but there is correlative evidence that every copy of this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with a 1.3x increase in likelihood of having the photic sneeze reflex.\n\nI have wanted to make a video about sun-sneezing for a long time. It is something I've experienced my whole life. When I go from a dark room indoors into full sunlight I invariably sneeze. I thought everyone did it. So my original question was why do people sneeze when they see bright light? That led me to consider what possible evolutionary advantages there could be to sneezing in sunlight. The obvious advantage to me is that sunlight kills pathogens of which there may be many in your snot or mucus. So sneezing in sunshine is a much better idea than sneezing inside a dark, damp cave where you may be living.\n\nFor more info, check out:\nWeb-Based, Participant-Driven Studies Yield Novel Genetic Associations for Common Traits\nhttp://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000993\n\nFilmed by Raquel Nuno",

A half-full container of honey does pretty well in reproducing the behaviour of the mystery cylinder. I wonder if the motion is a little smoother or more periodic with the ping-pong balls because they move as organized objects - also the delays between motion seemed to be longer with them than without ping pong balls.\n\n2. For the average speed track problem, every time I said velocity I meant speed. Sorry to the pedants out there who are perhaps looking for some trick answer due to displacement being zero when you run around a track.\n\n3. Although a lot of people identified it was something about a train's wheels that move backwards, fewer identified that specifically it was the part of the flange below the rail. Some simply said the bottom half of the wheel.\n\n4. The bicycle question is perhaps the most complex of these riddles. If you tried it with a bike you likely found that it went backwards. But what happens if you sit on the bike and only push backwards on the bottom pedal. The answer might surprise you so give it a shot!",

But few have ever done the experiment. Destin from Smarter Every Day and I performed identical experiments in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. What we found is the direction of water swirl in a toilet, sink, or bathtub is determined by other sources of angular momentum. However if the body of water is big enough, e.g. a kiddy pool, and left still for long enough (at least 24 hours), then the Coriolis effect is observable with water swirling counterclockwise in the Northern hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern hemisphere.\n\nVeritasium on Instagram: http://instagram.com/veritasium\nPatreon Support Link: http://www.patreon.com/veritasium\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/veritasium\nhttp://www.facebook.com/veritasium\n\nSmarter Every Day Instagram: http://instagram.com/smartereveryday\nPatreon Support Link: http://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/smartereveryday\nwww.facebook.com/SmarterEveryDay\n\nGordon McGladdery did all of the sound design for the video.

E. Knowles Middleton\n\nAbsolute Zero and the Conquest of Cold by Tom Shachtman\n\nThe Science of Measurement, A Historical Survey by Herbert Arthur Klein\n\nLehrbuch der Chemie by J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius\n\nScript:\nAs an Australian-Canadian the Fahrenheit temperature scale always seemsed a bit arbitrary. I mean why does water freeze at 32 degrees? And what exactly does zero represent?\n\nAccording to many sources the Fahrenheit scale was defined by setting zero degrees equal to the temperature of an ice, salt, and water mixture and 100 degrees being roughly equal to human body temperature. But that isn\u2019t true.\n\nThe real story is much more interesting, and scientific...\n\nAugust 14th 1701 was almost certainly the worst day in the life of fifteen year-old Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. On that day both of his parents died suddenly from mushroom poisoning. He was sent from Poland, where he lived, to Amsterdam to become an apprentice bookkeeper.\n\nBut Fahrenheit couldn\u2019t stand his apprenticeship and ran away so many times his employers put out a warrant for his arrest. Traveling from city to city around Europe, he became fascinated with scientific instruments and in particular thermometers.\n\nIn 1708, possibly seeking help with the warrant, Fahrenheit met with the mayor of Copenhagen, who happened to be the famous astronomer Ole Romer.\n\nRomer is known for observing the eclipses of Jupiter\u2019s moons and realizing that variations in the timing of those eclipses was caused by the time it took light to reach Earth. In other words, he found a way to accurately measure the finite speed of light.\n\nBut more pertinent to this story, in 1702 Romer was housebound after breaking his leg. To pass the time he devised a new temperature scale with the freezing point of water at 7.5 degrees and body temperature at 22.5 degrees.\n\nThis might seem odd until you consider that Romer wanted the boiling point of water to be 60 degrees (as an astronomer, he had experience dividing things by 60). If you take this scale, divide it in half, in half again, and in half once more, you find the freezing point of water 1/8th up the scale, and human body temperature 3/8th up the scale.\n\nSo at their meeting in 1708, Fahrenheit learned of Romer\u2019s temperature scale and adopted it as his own, adjusting it slightly because he found it \u201cinconvenient and inelegant on account of the fractional numbers\u201d. So he scaled them up to 8 and 24.\n\nThat is the original Fahrenheit scale. He produced thermometers for some time using this scale.\n\nBut then, at some later time Fahrenheit multiplied all numbers on his scale by four, setting freezing point to the now familiar 32 and body temperature to 96. It\u2019s unclear exactly why he did this. He may just have wanted finer precision in his measurements but I think there was a better reason.\n\nYou see, Fahrenheit was an excellent instrument maker. His thermometers agreed with each other precisely, at a time when that was unheard of. He pioneered the use of mercury as a measuring liquid, which has the benefit of a much higher boiling point than the alcohol used in most other thermometers at the time. For these accomplishments, he was inducted into the British Royal Society.\n\nAnd we know he read the works of Newton, Boyle, and Hooke, in which he would have come across the idea that a one degree increase in temperature should correspond to a specific fractional increase in the volume of the measuring liquid.\n\nAnd today a one degree Fahrenheit increase in temperature increases the volume of mercury by exactly one part in 10,000. Is this just a coincidence? We\u2019ll probably never know for sure because as an instrument maker Fahrenheit was secretive about his methods. But I think the data strongly suggests this was the case.\n\nSo what exactly did zero represent on the scales of Fahrenheit and Romer? By many accounts it\u2019s the temperature of a salt, ice and water mixture. But there are different descriptions of these mixtures and none of them actually produces the temperature they\u2019re supposed to. More likely I think they picked the coldest temperature in winter, set that as zero and later used ice and brine to calibrate new thermometers. Now his scale is only used regularly in the Cayman Islands, Bahamas, Belize, oh and the United States of America.",

If you want to try this experiment, instructions are here: link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12650-016-0383-5\n\nThe standard theory of quantum mechanics leaves a bit to be desired. As Richard Feynman put it, \"I think I can safely say that no one understands quantum mechanics.\" This is because observations of experiments have led us to a theory that contradicts common sense. The wave function contains all the information that is knowable about a particle, yet it can only be used to calculate probabilities of where a particle will likely turn up. It can't give us an actual account of where the particle went or where it will be at some later time.\n\nSome have suggested that this theory is incomplete. Maybe something is going on beneath the radar of standard quantum theory and somehow producing the appearance of randomness and uncertainty without actually being random or uncertain. Theories of this sort are called hidden variable theories because they propose entities that aren't observable. One such theory is pilot wave theory, first proposed by de Broglie, but later developed by Bohm. The idea here is that a particle oscillates, creating a wave. It then interacts with the wave and this complex interaction determines its motion.\n\nExperiments using silicone oil droplets on a vibrating bath provide a remarkable physical realization of pilot wave theories. They give us a physical picture of what the quantum world might look like if this is what's going on - and this theory is still deterministic. The particle is never in two places at once and there is no randomness.\n\nEdited by Robert Dahlem\n\nSound design by A Shell in the Pit",

We think of empty space as, well... empty, the epitome of nothingness. But as our understanding of physics has evolved we have realized that it's not truly empty. Space is filled with fields. There is a field for every subatomic particle. One for electrons, up quarks, down quarks, neutrinos and so on. In empty space these fields are basically zero, flat, nil. But it's impossible to make them perfectly zero so there are always some quantum fluctuations in the fields, even in a perfect vacuum. These are sometimes called virtual particles but they should really just be thought of as little disturbances in the field. Vacuum fluctuation play a role mediating the interactions of subatomic particles but they don't really have an impact on the large-scale structure of the universe, EXCEPT during inflation, right after the big bang when the universe increased in size 10^26 times. Due to this rapid expansion, those tiny fluctuations were blown up to the scale of the observable universe. And we know this by looking at the cosmic microwave background radiation where we can see slightly hotter and cooler parts of the early universe that correspond to density fluctuations. And it is these density fluctuations that allowed matter to clump together into large structures like the gigantic gas clouds that would go on to contain stars and planets. In case the video isn't clear, this is what I've been trying to say.\n\nAnimations by Gustavo Rosa\n\nThis video was sponsored in part by Dyson #ad",

This past December an avalanche in town destroyed 10 homes, which used to be here, killing two people.\n\nSo how did this cold, remote, ice-covered archipelago come to be inhabited?\n\nThe hills around town are rich in coal deposits that have been mined for over 100 years.\n\nThe coal was transported to the port via a series of aerial tramways some of which remain today, though they are no longer operational.\n\nCoal is a reminder that Svalbard was not always an Arctic ice world. 360 million years ago it was actually in the tropics North of the equator. A swampy area, it was covered with the precursors to modern ferns, which were much larger than they are today, reaching 10-30 metres in height.\n\nThis vegetation was then covered in mud and sand and submerged under the sea. Over time it turned into the coal deposits that in the 20th century brought miners from Norway, Russia, and the US.\n\nMost of the coal mines have now closed and the economy is gradually shifting towards tourism, education and research.\n\nTourists take trips on snowmobiles and dog sleds.\n\nThere is a university centre in Svalbard, which offers semester courses in biology, physics and geology.\n\nAnd up on the side of a mountain is the Svalbard Global seed vault\u2026 but that\u2019s a story for another time.\n\nThe locals tell me that interest in the region from different nations is increasing.\n\nAs the globe warms and Arctic ice shrinks, trade routes are opening up across the North. And Svalbard is strategically placed between North America, Asia and Europe.\n\nOne day in the future Svalbard may no longer be as cold or remote as it once was.\n\nBut for now it is a reminder of how through our ingenuity people can live in the most inhospitable of places.\n\nShot with a DJI Phantom 4 drone",

        "description": "Does quantum entanglement make faster-than-light communication possible?\nWhat is NOT random? http://bit.ly/NOTrandoVe\nFirst, I know this video is not easy to understand. Thank you for taking the time to attempt to understand it. I've been working on this for over six months over which time my understanding has improved. Quantum entanglement and spooky action at a distance are still debated by professors of quantum physics (I know because I discussed this topic with two of them).\n\nDoes hidden information (called hidden variables by physicists) exist? If it does, the experiment violating Bell inequalities indicates that hidden variables must update faster than light - they would be considered 'non-local'. On the other hand if you don't consider the spins before you make the measurement then you could simply say hidden variables don't exist and whenever you measure spins in the same direction you always get opposite results, which makes sense since angular momentum must be conserved in the universe.\n\nEveryone agrees that quantum entanglement does not allow information to be transmitted faster that light. There is no action either detector operator could take to signal the other one - regardless of the choice of measurement direction, the measured spins are random with 50/50 probability of up/down.\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nProf. Stephen Bartlett, University of Sydney: http://bit.ly/1xSosoJ\nProf. John Preskill, Caltech: http://bit.ly/1y8mJut\n\nLooking Glass Universe: http://bit.ly/17zZH7l\nPhysics Girl: http://bit.ly/PhysGirl\nMinutePhysics: http://bit.ly/MinPhys\nCommunity Channel: http://bit.ly/CommChannel\nNigel, Helen, Luke, and Simon for comments on earlier drafts of this video.\n\nFilmed in part by Scott Lewis: http://google.com/+scottlewis\n\nMusic by Amarante \"One Last Time\": http://bit.ly/VeAmarante",

This means that we often turn down reasonable opportunities for fear of the loss. However over the course of our lives we will be exposed to many risks and opportunities and this invariably means that taking every small reasonable bet will leave us better off than saying no to all of them.\n\nNOTE: The video is not saying to accept every bet, only those with reasonable odds (preferably in your favour), and those which if you lose would not cause significant financial or other damage. In those cases it is wise to be loss averse!\n\nFilmed by Adrian Tan\n\nThanks to Physics Girl for suggestions on previous versions of this video. https://www.youtube.com/physicswoman",

It will be broadcast in mid-2015, details to come. The filming took me to the most radioactive places on Earth (and some places, which surprisingly aren't as radioactive as you'd think). Chernobyl and Fukushima were incredible to see as they present post-apocalyptic landscapes. I also visited nuclear power plants, research reactors, Marie Curie's institute, Einstein's apartment, nuclear medicine areas of hospitals, uranium mines, nuclear bomb sites, and interviewed numerous experts.\n\nNotes about measuring radiation:\nSieverts are a measure of 'effective dose' - that means they measure the biological impact of the energy transferred to tissues from radiation.\n\nObviously I owe a debt to the fantastic chart made by xkcd, which inspired my visual approach to this video.\nhttps://xkcd.com/radiation/\n\nDOSES MAY VARY\nThe level of radiation varies widely around the world depending mainly on altitude and geology (excluding nuclear accidents).\n\nEstimates of particular doses also vary. All numbers reported in this video should be taken as order of magnitude only.\n\nThe most contentious claim may be that smokers receive the highest dose of ionizing radiation. This is not a whole body dose, but a dose to the lungs as specified in the video.

        "description": "Many technologies have promised to revolutionize education, but so far none has. With that in mind, what could revolutionize education?\nThese ideas have been percolating since I wrote my PhD in physics education: https://ve42.co/phd\nI have also discussed this topic with CGP Grey, whose view of the future of education differs significantly from mine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vsCAM17O-M\n\nI think it is instructive that each new technology has appeared to be so transformative. You can imagine, for example, that motion pictures must have seemed like a revolutionary learning technology. After all they did revolutionize entertainment, yet failed to make significant inroads into the classroom. TV and video seem like a cheaper, scaled back film, but they too failed to live up to expectations. Now there is a glut of information and video on the internet so should we expect it to revolutionize education?\n\nMy view is that it won't, for two reasons: 1. Technology is not inherently superior, animations over static graphics, videoed presentations over live lectures etc. and 2. Learning is inherently a social activity, motivated and encouraged by interactions with others.\n\nFilmed and edited by Pierce Cook\n\nSupported by Screen Australia's Skip Ahead program.\n\nMusic By Kevin MacLeod, www.incompetech.com \"The Builder\" and by Amarante Music: http://www.amarantemusic.com",

Recent archeological evidence suggests they were instead constructed by paid workers. Some may have performed this work as a form of tax payment for several months of the year. Skilled engineers would have planned and orchestrated the building. An estimated 10,000-20,000 people would have been working on a pyramid at any one point in time. They were well fed and provided with shelter near the pyramids. Plus their burial sites close by indicate they were respected and were not slaves.\n\nMuch of the limestone was quarried from the Giza plateau itself, meaning the stones did not need to be transported far. The granite casing of Menkaure's pyramid, on the other hand, was transported from Aswan, around 600 miles, or 1000 km up the Nile.\n\nEditing assistance by Dustin Chow\n\nMusic by Kevin MacLeod, Incompetech.com \"Desert City\" and \"Ibn Al-Noor\"",

Animation courtesy of http://wehi.tv\nMusic by Amarante: http://bit.ly/VeAmarante\nAnimation: Etsuko Uno\nArt and Technical Direction: Drew Berry\nSound Design: Francois Tetaz & Emma Bortignon\nScientific Consultation: Marnie Blewitt\nCourtesy of Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research: http://wehi.tv\n\nWhen a female embryo is four days old it consists of just 100 cells. At this point the x-chromosome from Mom and the one from Dad are both active. But in order for proper development to occur, one of the x chromosomes must be switched off.\n\nThrough a tiny molecular battle within each cell, one of the x-chromosomes wins and remains active while the loser is deactivated.\n\nThis is done by wrapping the DNA tighter around proteins, modifying histone tails, and DNA methylation - molecular markers to indicate this DNA should not be read.\n\nWhat's surprising is that it's pretty random which x chromosome wins - sometimes it's Mom's and sometimes it's Dad's. So when a female is just 100 cells big, her cells have a mix of active x-chromosomes, some from Mom and some from Dad.",

During inflation the universe expanded faster than light, but that's something that actually happens all the time, it's happening right now. This doesn't violate Einstein's theory of relativity since nothing is moving through space faster than light, it's just that space itself is expanding such that far away objects are receding rapidly from each other. Common sense would dictate that objects moving away from us faster than light should be invisible, but they aren't. This is because light can travel from regions of space which are superluminal relative to us into regions that are subluminal. So our observable universe is bigger than our Hubble sphere - it's limited by the particle horizon, the distance light could travel to us since the beginning of time as we know it.",

This I find surprising and interesting - that evolution doesn't come to the best solution, it comes to the most stable one.\n\nThe Forest of Friendship was a concept I first came across in Richard Dawkin's book \"The Greatest Show on Earth.\" One point I'd like to clarify is that being taller comes with a cost - having a longer trunk requires costly expenditure of energy. However, in a forest of uniformly short trees, being a little taller conveys an advantage. That is until all the other trees catch up, at which time the extra height no longer provides a benefit. So over time as the whole forest rises up the conditions are getting worse for each tree, but they are powerless to stop the evolutionary arms race.\n\nHuge thank you to Brady Haran for filming (and summarizing the main points at the end of the film).

I was startled at how hard it was for people to investigate number sets that didn't follow their hypotheses, even when their method wasn't getting them anywhere.\n\nIn the video I say \"when people came to Australia...\" by which I meant, \"when Europeans who believed all swans were white came to Australia...\" I did not mean any offence to Indigenous Australians who were already in Australia at that time. Please accept my apologies for the poor phrasing if you were offended by it.\n\nThis video was inspired by The Black Swan by Nassim Taleb and filmed by my mum. Thanks mum!\n\nPartly my motivation came from responses to my Facebook videos - social media marketers saying 'Facebook ads have worked for me so there can't be fake likes.' Just because you have only seen white swans, doesn't mean there are no black ones. And in fact marketers are only looking for white swans. They think it was invalid of me to make the fake Virtual Cat page: 'well of course if it's a low quality page you're going to get low quality likes.' But my point is this is black swan bait, something they would never make because their theory is confident in the exclusive existence of white swans.",

To me this sounded like unsubstantiated rubbish, like the claim the Great Wall is the only manmade structure visible from space. So I put my own psyche on the line, subjecting myself to over an hour of the most intense quiet on Earth. No, this was not THE quietest room on Earth (-9dB) but it is one of the quietest, and the truth is once you put a person inside, they are by far the loudest thing in there so the sound rating of the room is irrelevant.\n\nI was not surprised to find that I could stay in there for as long as I liked and feel perfectly fine. What was surprising is that my heartbeat was audible. You can hear it on the sound recording. Now I wasn't consciously aware of the sound of my heart while in the room, but I was more aware of the feeling of it beating.\n\nHuge thank you to everyone at BYU: Duane Merrell, Spencer Perry, Cameron Vongsawad, Jazz Myers, Ann Clawson, and Robert Willes.",

        "description": "Evidence Facebook's revenue is based on fake likes.\nMy first vid on the problem with Facebook: http://bit.ly/1dXudqY\nI know first-hand that Facebook's advertising model is deeply flawed. When I paid to promote my page I gained 80,000 followers in developing countries who didn't care about Veritasium (but I wasn't aware of this at the time). They drove my reach and engagement numbers down, basically rendering the page useless. I am not the only one who has experienced this. Rory Cellan-Jones had the same luck with Virtual Bagel: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18819338\n\nThe US Department of State spent $630,000 to acquire 2 million page likes and then realized only 2% were engaged. http://wapo.st/1glcyZo\n\nI thought I would demonstrate that the same thing is still happening now by creating Virtual Cat (http://www.facebook.com/MyVirtualCat). I was surprised to discover something worse - false likes are coming from everywhere, including Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia. So even those carefully targeting their campaigns are likely being duped into spending real money on fake followers. Then when they try to reach their followers they have to pay again.\n\nAnd it's possible to be a victim of fake likes without even advertising. Pages that end up on Facebook's \"International Suggested Pages\" are also easy targets for click-farms seeking to diversify their likes. http://tnw.co/NsflrC\n\nThanks to Henry, Grey, and Nessy for feedback on earlier drafts of this video.",

Rocks that attract or repel each other at a distance - that's really cool - and electric current in a wire interacts in the same way. What's even more amazing is how it works. We normally think of special relativity as having little bearing on our lives because everything happens at such low speeds that relativistic effects are negligible. But when you consider the large number of charges in a wire and the strength of the electric interaction, you can see that electromagnets function thanks to the special relativistic effect of length contraction. In a frame of reference moving with the charges, there is an electric field that creates a force on the charges. But in the lab frame, there is no electric field so it must be a magnetic field creating the force. Hence we see that a magnetic field is what an electric field becomes when an electrically charged object starts moving.\n\nI was inspired to make this video by Prof. Eric Mazur http://mazur.harvard.edu/emdetails.php\n\nHuge thank you to Ralph at the School of Physics, University of Sydney for helping us out with all this magnetic gear.

This was one of my favorite experiments as a kid. Your hand slides into the slime easily when moving slowly but the mixture behaves as a solid if you hit it quickly. That is what is meant by 'non-Newtonian' - the fluid's properties change depending on its relative motion. These properties can be exploited to dramatic effect as has been shown on speaker cones before. Here I wanted to understand what is going on, what frequencies and amplitudes work best so I used a slow-mo camera.\n\nThanks to everyone at the YouTube Space LA for helping me film this.

Now we look at the practical side of making a quantum bit, or qubit. How do you put it in a state where it is stable? How do you read and write information on it? These processes are described for a solid state qubit - a phosphorous atom in a silicon crystal substrate. Both the electron and the nucleus of the phosphorous atom can be used as qubits.\n\nThanks to A/Prof. Andrea Morello: http://bit.ly/17wZ7lt\n\nThanks to Henry Reich (MinutePhysics) for pushing me to make the explanations and visualizations clearer.",

Our lives depend on this device.\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://bit.ly/VePatreon\nSubscribe to Veritasium - it's FREE! http://bit.ly/YSWpWm\n\nWhen I mentioned to people that I was doing a video on transistors, they would say \"as in a transistor radio?\" Yes! That's exactly what I mean, but it goes so much deeper than that. After the transistor was invented in 1947 one of the first available consumer technologies it was applied to was radios, so they could be made portable and higher quality. Hence the line in 'Brown-eyed Girl' - \"going down to the old mine with a transistor radio.\"\n\nBut more important to our lives today, the transistor made possible the microcomputer revolution, and hence the Internet, and also TVs, mobile phones, fancy washing machines, dishwashers, calculators, satellites, projectors etc. etc. A transistor is based on semiconductor material, usually silicon, which is 'doped' with impurities to carefully change its electrical properties. These n and p-type semiconductors are then put together in different configurations to achieve a desired electrical result. And in the case of the transistor, this is to make a tiny electrical switch. These switches are then connected together to perform computations, store information, and basically make everything electrical work intelligently.\n\nSpecial thanks to PhD Comics for awesome animations: http://bit.ly/16ZXcVY\n\nAnd thanks to Henry Reich and Vanessa Hill for reviews of earlier drafts of this video.\n\nMusic: Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Decisions",

Thanks to audible.com for supporting this episode: http://bit.ly/ZJ5Q6z\nThe Higgs mechanism is meant to account for the mass of everything, right? Well no, only the fundamental particles, which means that electrons derive their mass entirely from the Higgs interaction but protons and neutrons, made of quarks, do not. In fact the quark masses are so small that they only make up about 1% of the mass of the proton (and a similar fraction of the neutron). The rest of the mass comes from the energy in the gluon field. Gluons are massless, but there is so much energy in the field that by E=mc^2 there is a significant amount of mass there. This is where most of your mass comes from and the mass of virtually everything around you.\n\nThanks to Professor Derek Leinweber for his great images, animations and explanations.

The reason it looks empty is because electrons and photons don't interact with the stuff that is there, quark and gluon field fluctuations.\nIt actually takes energy to clear out space and make a true 'empty' vacuum. This seems incredibly counter-intuitive but we can make an analogy to a permanent magnet. When at low energies, like at room temperature, there is a magnetic field around the magnet due to the alignment of all the magnetic moments of the atoms. But if you add some energy to it by heating it, the particles gain thermal energy, which above the Curie temperature makes their magnetic moments randomly oriented and hence destroying the magnetic field. So in this case energy is needed to clear out the field, just as in the quantum vacuum.\n\nSpecial thanks to Professor Derek Leinweber, find out more about his research here: http://bit.ly/ZZTKFP",

Literally. The original name for it was the 'grave', proposed in 1793 but it fell victim to the French Revolution like its creator, Lavoisier. So begins the tale of the most unusual SI unit. The kilogram is the only base unit with a prefix in its name, and the only one still defined by a physical artifact, the international prototype kilogram or IPK.\n\nBut the problem with this definition has long been apparent. The IPK doesn't seem to maintain its mass compared to 40 similar cylinders minted at the same time. The goal is therefore to eliminate the kilogram's dependence on a physical object. Two main approaches are being considered to achieve this end: the Avogadro Project and the Watt Balance.\n\nThe Avogadro project aims to redefine Avogadro's constant (currently defined by the kilogram -- the number of atoms in 12 g of carbon-12) and reverse the relationship so that the kilogram is precisely specified by Avogadro's constant. This method required creating the most perfect sphere on Earth. It is made out of a single crystal of silicon 28 atoms. By carefully measuring the diameter, the volume can be precisely specified. Since the atom spacing of silicon is well known, the number of atoms in a sphere can be accurately calculated. This allows for a very precise determination of Avogadro's constant.\n\nSpecial thanks to Katie Green, Dr. David Farrant, the CSIRO, and the National Measurment Institute for their help. Thanks also to Nessy Hill for filming and reviewing earlier drafts of this video.\n\nThere is debate as to whether this is truly the roundest object ever created.

In 1801 Thomas Young seemed to settle a long-running debate about the nature of light with his double slit experiment. He demonstrated that light passing through two slits creates patterns like water waves, with the implication that it must be a wave phenomenon.\n\nHowever, experimental results in the early 1900s found that light energy is not smoothly distributed as in a classical wave, rather it comes in discrete packets, called quanta and later photons. These are indivisible particles of light. So what would happen if individual photons passed through a double slit? Would they make a pattern like waves or like particles?",

For clarification on this video, please see: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7tfrTh66c\nWhat would you see if you were drifting through space, looking back at the sun? Well its light intensity would decrease as the inverse square of distance from the sun. And you would imagine the intensity would decrease smoothly, asymptotically approaching zero.\n\nBut this is not what happens.\n\nIf you had sensitive enough eyes, like frogs' eyes, you would find that at some point the sun would start to flicker. You would see flashes of light separated by complete darkness. And as you drift further from the sun, what's strange is that these flashes do not decrease in brightness, but they do become less frequent. That's because light comes in lumps, called quanta or photons, which are indivisible. So if you try to spread light out very thinly, you reach a point where there are only single bits of light reaching an observer's eye at any given time.\n\nI should acknowledge the book \"The Fabric of Reality\" by David Deutsch, which contains a similar story about a frog and a torch.

        "description": "Light is so common that we rarely think about what it really is. But just over two hundred years ago, a groundbreaking experiment answered the question that had occupied physicists for centuries. Is light made up of waves or particles?\n\nThe experiment was conducted by Thomas Young and is known as Young's Double Slit Experiment. This famous experiment is actually a simplification of a series of experiments on light conducted by Young. In a completely darkened room, Young allowed a thin beam of sunlight to pass through an aperture on his window and onto two narrow, closely spaced openings (the double slit). This sunlight then cast a shadow onto the wall behind the apparatus. Young found that the light diffracted as it passed through the slits, and then interfered with itself, created a series of light and dark spots. Since the sunlight consists of all colours of the rainbow, these colours were also visible in the projected spots. Young concluded that light consist of waves and not particles since only waves were known to diffract and interfere in exactly the manner that light did in his experiment.\n\nThe way I have always seen this experiment performed is with a laser and a manufactured double slit but since the experiment was conducted in 1801 I have always thought that it should be possible to recreate the experiment using sunlight and household materials. That is basically what I did here. I will show the interference pattern I observed with my homemade double slit on 2Veritasium but I chose to use a manufactured double slit here to ensure that the pattern was impressive for observers at the beach.\n\nSpecial thanks to Henry, Brady, and Rupert for their cameos, Glen for filming and Josh for helping create the apparatus. Thanks also to the Royal Society for allowing us to view the original manuscript of Young's lecture and the University of Sydney for lending the double slits.\n\nMusic by Kevin Mcleod (incompetech.com) Danse Macabre, Scissors",

So I set out to find the truth: why have all these venomous species evolved in the world's best holiday destinations?\n\nI asked chemists, visited the zoo, interviewed entomologists and snake experts. The answer I found was complicated:\n1. The majority of venomous species are ectotherms, cold-blooded creatures whose internal temperatures are governed by their surroundings.\n2. This means they have limited periods of activity - mainly while it's warm out, and can only exert short bursts of energy, so they are generally \"sit and wait\" predators. This may explain why they, more than mammals or birds, evolved venom.\n3. It also explains why there are more of these species in warm climates. There are more of all species in warm climates, but this trend is especially pronounced for ectotherms.\n4. So there are a greater number of venomous species in warm places, simply because there are more species in warm places. Cold climates still have venomous creatures, like the rattlesnakes of Canada and European vipers.\n5. But history also has a role to play. In Australia, there were no snakes until 20 million years ago when a venomous sea snake from Asia encountered the land, sending venomous species to all corners of the continent. Later non-venomous arrivals have done well in the tropics but not as well in Australia's colder climates, so venomous types still dominate there. Hawaii has no venomous land snakes and nor does Jamaica.\n6. The recent ice age also would have driven ectotherms from the northern parts of the Northern Hemisphere. This is why there are no snakes in Ireland, for example.\n\nSpecial thanks to Prof. Rick Shine, Prof. Dieter Hochuli, Prof. Roger Lowe, Prof. Martyn Poliakoff and Taronga Zoo, especially Joe Haddock and Dean Purcell.\n\nCinematography by Charles Clement",

In our everyday lives we virtually never come up against this limit, hence why it seems peculiar. In this experiment a laser is shone through a narrow slit onto a screen. As the slit is made narrower, the spot on the screen also becomes narrower. But at a certain point, the spot starts becoming wider. This is because the photons of light have been so localised at the slit that their horizontal momentum must become less well defined in order to satisfy Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.\n\nI based this video on one by Prof. Walter Lewin of MIT: http://bit.ly/100Wk2K\n\nHenry (MinutePhysics) has previously made a video about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle where he treats it as less spooky and more a consequence of waves: http://bit.ly/TV3xO5\n\nSixty Symbols has a great video on Planck's constant: http://bit.ly/11upebY\n\nThanks to the University of Sydney for hosting this experiment, especially to Tom and Ralph for their assistance getting it working.\n\nMusic: Kevin McLeod (Incompetech.com) Mirage and Danse Macabre",

When the magnet was moved relative to the coil, current was induced in the coil. A similar experiment can be performed with a copper tube and a magnet. Although copper is not magnetic, it is a conductor. As the magnet falls through the pipe, the magnetic field changes over different sections of the pipe. This induces swirling currents (called eddy currents), which create a magetic field that opposes the motion of the magnet. This means work must be done to move the magnet through the pipe. This work generates the electrical energy, which is then dissipated as thermal energy in the pipe. The same basic principle is used to generate electricity throughout the world: moving a magnet inside copper coils.\n\nExperiments A Cappella http://bit.ly/TtdflV\nWhere Did The Earth Come From http://bit.ly/VQBzQJ\nThe Coastline Paradox http://bit.ly/TIapxM\nMicrowave Grape Plasma http://bit.ly/QkCwUt\n\n\nMusic by Kevin McLeod (http://www.incompetech.com) Sneaky Snitch and Danse Macabre",

Its spin appears to be 0 or 2 but more results are required to nail this down. If it is the standard model Higgs, the spin should be 0, resulting in a fairly symmetric distribution of decay products in the detectors.\n\nWe may know this year if it's not the standard model Higgs - this would be the case if it doesn't decay into specific particles with the expected frequency. However if it is the standard model Higgs, it may take many more years to be certain. The large hadron collider will be shut down in 2013 for upgrades so that higher energies up to 14 TeV can be tested. Right now the LHC is operating at 8 TeV.

This is by far the best demonstration of electromagnetic induction I have ever seen.\n\nBack in London, I visited the magnetic lab of Michael Faraday in the basement of the Royal Institution. It was here that he did his groundbreaking work on induction. People had previously observed that current in a wire causes a compass needle to deflect, but more exciting was the prospect of using a magnetic field to generate current. Faraday created his famous induction ring by winding two coils of insulated wire onto an iron ring. When he connected a battery to one coil, a small pulse of current was induced in the other. When the battery was disconnected, current was induced in the other direction. This led Faraday to the conclusion that current was induced in the second coil only when the magnetic field through it was changing.\n\nAnd if they hadn't been wrapped on the same ring, Faraday may have noticed that the two coils repel each other when the current is induced due to the interaction of their magnetic fields. This is the same thing that is happening with the aluminium plate, except we're using alternating current to create a continually changing magnetic field. This induces an alternating current in the plate, producing an opposing magnetic field which levitates the disk.",

We then poured the solid and liquid nitrogen mixture onto a tray of water. The surface of the water became so cold that CO2 solidified out of the atmosphere on its surface.

At the bottom, the pressure is atmospheric, and at the top, the lowest pressure you can create is a perfect vacuum (pressure = 0). Atmospheric pressure can support a water column about 10m high - BUT with 0 pressure at the top, the water would start boiling. This is called cavitation and it obviously can't be happening in trees.\nAfter I posted the straw video, I received a lot of questions about how trees could be taler than 10m. I assumed there was a simple answer because there are plenty of trees taller than that. But as I asked around and read articles about it, I couldn't really find an explanation I was happy with.\n\nMaybe there is not a continuous water column inside the tree, so each section only lifts water a little ways? This could be but it seems to require a series of pump mechanisms, and how would you join this pump sections together? Perhaps capillary action is holding the water up? But the xylem tubes in a tree seem too wide (~50 um) for this effect to be significant. Maybe osmotic pressure could push the water from below rather than sucking it up from above? But some trees live in mangroves, where there is much higher solute concentration in the sea water than in their roots, so osmosis would work the other way.\n\nEventually I spoke to a plant biologist and sorted this all out, but I wanted to give you a little back to school challenge. How do you think this could work?",

The standard idea is that the wind pushes the sails from behind, causing the boat to move forward. Although this technique is used at times, it is not the most efficient way to sail a boat (and it means the boat can never go faster than the wind). Lift is the key mechanism driving a boat forwards. As air flows over the sails, it moves faster over the outer side, creating lower pressure than on the inner side. This produces a force which is mostly to the side and a bit forwards. Lift on the centerboard pushes to the opposite side, cancelling the sideways force and adding a forward component of force to the boat.\n\nnumberphile http://bit.ly/numberphile\nefit30         http://bit.ly/O4CMme\nappchat         http://bit.ly/NxAMlX\nerikaanear         http://bit.ly/MdyUzQ\nwhoisjimmy http://bit.ly/LtFzpW\nminutephysics http://bit.ly/Muh6CC\n1veritasium http://bit.ly/MrupzL",

The big idea is that the torque vector increases angular momentum in the direction of torque. So if there is no angular momentum initially, it will cause the system to swing in such a direction that it is rotating with new angular momentum in the direction of the torque. However, if there was angular momentum to begin with, the torque will change the direction of that angular momentum by causing precession.",

But of course there is gravity in space, especially where the space station is located (only about 400km from Earth's surface). So astronauts still experience a gravitational pull - it's just that they and the space station are in free fall so they are accelerating together towards the Earth. The space station doesn't crash into the Earth because of its orbital velocity - it's going 28,000 km/h so as it falls, the Earth curves away from it.",

The most common idea is that the sun is burning gas - like a giant fireball in the sky. If this were true, the sun would have gone out long ago. So how is the sun actually fuelling itself? It is converting its own mass into energy. By combining protons (the nucleus of hydrogen) into helium, it squeezes some mass into energy - 4.3 billion kg per second. It is Einstein's famous E=mc^2 which gives us the quantitative relationship between mass and energy, where c is the speed of light.",

Theories about its origins have been debated for centuries and common misconceptions persist that the aurora is the sun's rays scattered off ice crystals in the high atmosphere. In truth, the light is created more than 100km above Earth's surface as high speed electrons and protons ejected from the sun in a solar flare or coronal mass ejection collide with air molecules in the upper atmosphere. The charged particles from the sun excite air molecules which then de-excite by emitting light. The display is most common around the north and south poles because the Earth's magnetic field deflects the solar wind from the equator to the poles. Here the magnetic field dips towards the Earth's surface, channeling the charged particles into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nMusic is by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com, the song is called Mirage",

What is actually burning is wax vapour which is drawn up through the wick. When you blow a candle out, wax vapour continues to rise off the candle so you can light this vapour which burns back down to the wick, relighting the candle.",

This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.",

When we do that, we find electrons do not neccessarily occupy circles or spheres in space. Rather their probability densities make all sorts of interesting shapes from the dumbell to the peanut with the donut around it.",

If you hold a mirror in front of your face, will you see your reflection in a mirror? How could light from your face reach the mirror if the mirror is travelling away from you? But it would be a pretty spooky train if you couldn't see your reflection so Einstein felt this solution wasn't realistic. On the other hand if you could see your reflection, it would mean light was travelling at the speed of light inside the train. But that meant the same light observed from outside the train would be going twice the speed of light. This again seems inconsistent. So Einstein resolved that you must see your reflection but that light must travel at the same speed inside and outside the train. The only way this is possible is if space and time are perceived differently by observers inside and outside the train.",

It makes it more difficult to see when objects are accelerating since the eye tracks all motion quite smoothly.",

That's more than 9 billion years before the Earth formed (what happened during that time?), and 2) After the Big Bang the universe consisted of only Hydrogen and Helium - not great raw material for building the Earth. The truth is the big bang formed stars, which exploded and then (perhaps) formed more stars, which exploded and then formed our solar system, including the Earth.

Later, the discovery of radioactivity provided a mechanism by which the Earth's core could be continually heated. This meant it was much older than previous estimates of 20-40 million years based on the cooling rate of the Earth.

However it is debatable whether they really work. Research has shown that these types of videos may be positively received by students. They feel like they are learning and become more confident in their answers, but tests reveal they haven't learned anything. The apparent reason for the discrepancy is misconceptions. Students have existing ideas about scientific phenomena before viewing a video. If the video presents scientific concepts in a clear, well illustrated way, students believe they are learning but they do not engage with the media on a deep enough level to realize that what was is presented differs from their prior knowledge. There is hope, however.

So as they accelerate towards the Earth, the Earth curves away beneath them and they never get any closer. Since the astronauts have the same acceleration as the space station, they feel weightless.

Most people would say no, the Earth exerts a greater force of attraction because it is larger and has more mass. This is a situation in which Newton's Third Law is relevant. Newton's Third Law says that for every force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force. So the force the Earth exerts on the moon must be exactly equal and opposite the force the moon exerts on the Earth. But how can that be - that the same size force keeps the moon orbiting, but barely affects the Earth? The answer is inertia - the tendency for all objects with mass to maintain their state of motion. Since the Earth has much more mass than the moon, it has greater inertia and therefore experiences much less acceleration for the same amount of force.",

Most people can identify the gravitational force down, but there must be something else otherwise you would accelerate down towards the center of the Earth. The other main force on you is called the normal force. It is a force perpendicular to the surface that supports you, like the ground or the seat of your chair. You compress this surface and it acts like a spring, pushing you up.",

If you stop the shell, the yolk inside continues to move due to its inertia and it therefore gets the egg spinning again.",

This video aims to tease out the difference between mass and weight by asking people what makes a car difficult to push. The standard answer is that it is difficult to push because it's heavy. But heaviness is a measure of weight, the gravitational pull of the Earth attracting the car to Earth's center. When the car is pushed on a flat road, the force of gravity does not oppose the motion. Instead the resistance felt is an indication of the car's mass which determines its inertia. Inertia is the property of matter that means it tends to resist acceleration - the greater the mass, the less the acceleration for a given amount of force.",

They saw a glow from the tube that seemed to emanate from the negatively charged plate called the cathode. Since scientists didn't know what the glow was they called it a cathode ray. There was debate over whether the cathode ray was a wave phenomenon like light or a stream of negatively charged particles. JJ Thomson effectively resolved the debate in 1897 by performing a clever experiment that determined the charge to mass ratio of the particles making up the cathode ray. He also showed that this same particle was in all different cathode materials so it must be a constituent common to all atoms. This changed our understanding of the atom from the previous billiard ball model to Thomson's plum pudding model of the atom.",

He had performed a series of experiments and was credited with the discovery of the first sub-atomic particle, the electron. He therefore proposed a new model of the atom called the plum pudding model. In this model, the plums represent negatively charged electrons which can be plucked out of the atom, leaving behind some positively charged pudding. In this film, cherry tart is used as a delicious substitute for plum pudding.",
