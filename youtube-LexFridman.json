        "description": "David Patterson is a Turing award winner and professor of computer science at Berkeley. He is known for pioneering contributions to RISC processor architecture used by 99% of new chips today and for co-creating RAID storage. The impact that these two lines of research and development have had on our world is immeasurable. He is also one of the great educators of computer science in the world. His book with John Hennessy \"Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach\" is how I first learned about and was humbled by the inner workings of machines at the lowest level.\n\nSupport this podcast by signing up with these sponsors:\n- Jordan Harbinger Show: https://jordanharbinger.com/lex/\n- Cash App - use code \"LexPodcast\" and download:\n- Cash App (App Store): https://apple.co/2sPrUHe\n- Cash App (Google Play): https://bit.ly/2MlvP5w\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website:\nhttps://lexfridman.com/podcast\nApple Podcasts:\nhttps://apple.co/2lwqZIr\nSpotify:\nhttps://spoti.fi/2nEwCF8\nRSS:\nhttps://lexfridman.com/feed/podcast/\nFull episodes playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4\nClips playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeciFP3CBCIEElOJeitOr41\n\nOUTLINE:\n0:00 - Introduction\n3:28 - How have computers changed?\n4:22 - What's inside a computer?\n10:02 - Layers of abstraction\n13:05 - RISC vs CISC computer architectures\n28:18 - Designing a good instruction set is an art\n31:46 - Measures of performance\n36:02 - RISC instruction set\n39:39 - RISC-V open standard instruction set architecture\n51:12 - Why do ARM implementations vary?\n52:57 - Simple is beautiful in instruction set design\n58:09 - How machine learning changed computers\n1:08:18 - Machine learning benchmarks\n1:16:30 - Quantum computing\n1:19:41 - Moore's law\n1:28:22 - RAID data storage\n1:36:53 - Teaching\n1:40:59 - Wrestling\n1:45:26 - Meaning of life\n\nCONNECT:\n- Subscribe to this YouTube channel\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/LexFridmanPage\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman\n- Medium: https://medium.com/@lexfridman\n- Support on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lexfridman",

        "description": "Dmitry Korkin is a professor of bioinformatics and computational biology at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where he specializes in bioinformatics of complex disease, computational genomics, systems biology, and biomedical data analytics. I came across Dmitry's work when in February his group used the viral genome of the COVID-19 to reconstruct the 3D structure of its major viral proteins and their interactions with human proteins, in effect creating a structural genomics map of the coronavirus and making this data open and available to researchers everywhere. We talked about the biology of COVID-19, SARS, and viruses in general, and how computational methods can help us understand their structure and function in order to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines.\n\nSupport this podcast by signing up with these sponsors:\n- Cash App - use code \"LexPodcast\" and download:\n- Cash App (App Store): https://apple.co/2sPrUHe\n- Cash App (Google Play): https://bit.ly/2MlvP5w\n\nEPISODE LINKS:\nDmitry's Website: http://korkinlab.org/\nDmitry's Twitter: https://twitter.com/dmkorkin\nDmitry's Paper that we discuss: https://bit.ly/3eKghEM\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website:\nhttps://lexfridman.com/podcast\nApple Podcasts:\nhttps://apple.co/2lwqZIr\nSpotify:\nhttps://spoti.fi/2nEwCF8\nRSS:\nhttps://lexfridman.com/feed/podcast/\nFull episodes playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4\nClips playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeciFP3CBCIEElOJeitOr41\n\nOUTLINE:\n0:00 - Introduction\n2:33 - Viruses are terrifying and fascinating\n6:02 - How hard is it to engineer a virus?\n10:48 - What makes a virus contagious?\n29:52 - Figuring out the function of a protein\n53:27 - Functional regions of viral proteins\n1:19:09 - Biology of a coronavirus treatment\n1:34:46 - Is a virus alive?\n1:37:05 - Epidemiological modeling\n1:55:27 - Russia\n2:02:31 - Science bobbleheads\n2:06:31 - Meaning of life\n\nCONNECT:\n- Subscribe to this YouTube channel\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/LexFridmanPage\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman\n- Medium: https://medium.com/@lexfridman\n- Support on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lexfridman",

Here are the lyrics:\n\nthe way out\n\nmy granddad was a soldier\non the fronts in 41\nthe bullets took his brothers\nbut his stubborn luck held on\n\nthe sky was filled with fire\nmillions lost in flames\nhate and love were all there\nand the world's never the same\n\n some days will sink in sadness\n and the weight of them too tough\n don't lose yourself to madness\n the way out is love\n\nwhen the new york towers crumbled\nwe were all new yorkers too\nfor a moment all just human\nnot the same old red or blue\n\nand the wicked'll go on scheming\nfor the power in the pain\nbut the heart that longs for freedom\nis a fire they'll never tame\n\n some days will sink in sadness\n and the weight of them too tough\n don't lose yourself to madness\n the way out is love\n\nthe virus took our comfort\nthat was never  ours to own\nwhen the enemy is inside us\nwe're together but alone\n\nthis life is so damn fragile\na leaf caught by the wind\nbut every breath that's tragic\nignites a hope within\n\n some days will sink in sadness\n and the weight of them too tough\n don't lose yourself to madness\n the way out is love",

He is one of the best communicators of what it takes to be a good leader, to inspire, and to build businesses that solve big difficult challenges.\n\n* Note about the new addition on the table: Hedgy is a stuffed hedgehog toy that I got in a thrift store many years ago. He jumped out at me because he seemed to be deep in thought and bothered by something profound, in stark contrast to other stuffed animals that usually have an aloof, empty smile on their face. I gave away almost all my stuff in the name of minimalism a couple of times, and he survived all of that. There's a longer story there. If you're curious, ask me and I'll do one of the AMA videos about Hedgy. In general, people asked to put more stuff in the scene. I don't have much stuff. So what you get is Hedgy.\n\nSupport this podcast by signing up with these sponsors:\n- MasterClass: https://masterclass.com/lex\n- Cash App - use code \"LexPodcast\" and download:\n- Cash App (App Store): https://apple.co/2sPrUHe\n- Cash App (Google Play): https://bit.ly/2MlvP5w\n\nEPISODE LINKS:\nSimon twitter: https://twitter.com/simonsinek\nSimon facebook: https://www.facebook.com/simonsinek\nSimon website: https://simonsinek.com/\nBooks:\n- Infinite Game: https://amzn.to/2wva7ae\n- Leaders Eat Last: https://amzn.to/2xf70Ds\n- Start with Why: https://amzn.to/2WxBH1i\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website:\nhttps://lexfridman.com/podcast\nApple Podcasts:\nhttps://apple.co/2lwqZIr\nSpotify:\nhttps://spoti.fi/2nEwCF8\nRSS:\nhttps://lexfridman.com/feed/podcast/\nFull episodes playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4\nClips playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeciFP3CBCIEElOJeitOr41\n\nOUTLINE:\n0:00 - Introduction\n3:50 - Meaning of life as an infinite game\n10:13 - Optimism\n13:30 - Mortality\n17:52 - Hard work\n26:38 - Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, and leadership\n\nCONNECT:\n- Subscribe to this YouTube channel\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/LexFridmanPage\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman\n- Medium: https://medium.com/@lexfridman\n- Support on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lexfridman",

        "description": "Ann Druyan is the writer, producer, director, and one of the most important and impactful communicators of science in our time. She co-wrote the 1980 science documentary series Cosmos hosted by Carl Sagan, whom she married in 1981, and her love for whom, with the help of NASA, was recorded as brain waves on a golden record along with other things our civilization has to offer and launched into space on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft that are now, 42 years later, still active, reaching out farther into deep space than any human-made object ever has. This was a profound and beautiful decision she made as a Creative Director of NASA's Voyager Interstellar Message Project. In 2014, she went on to create the second season of Cosmos, called Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, and in 2020, the new third season called Cosmos: Possible Worlds, which is being released this upcoming Monday, March 9.

He is the author of the popular book \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" that summarizes in an accessible way his research of several decades, often in collaboration with Amos Tversky, on cognitive biases, prospect theory, and happiness. The central thesis of this work is a dichotomy between two modes of thought: \"System 1\" is fast, instinctive and emotional; \"System 2\" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The book delineates cognitive biases associated with each type of thinking.\n\nSubscribe to this YouTube channel or connect on:\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/lexfridman\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman\n- Medium: https://medium.com/@lexfridman\n- Support on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lexfridman",

He is the author of the popular book \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" that summarizes in an accessible way his research of several decades, often in collaboration with Amos Tversky, on cognitive biases, prospect theory, and happiness. The central thesis of this work is a dichotomy between two modes of thought: \"System 1\" is fast, instinctive and emotional; \"System 2\" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The book delineates cognitive biases associated with each type of thinking.\n\nSubscribe to this YouTube channel or connect on:\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/lexfridman\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman\n- Medium: https://medium.com/@lexfridman\n- Support on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lexfridman",

It is a father giving advice to his son.\n\nIf you can keep your head when all about you   \n    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   \nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n    But make allowance for their doubting too;   \nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\n    Or being lied about, don\u2019t deal in lies,\nOr being hated, don\u2019t give way to hating,\n    And yet don\u2019t look too good, nor talk too wise:\n\nIf you can dream\u2014and not make dreams your master;   \n    If you can think\u2014and not make thoughts your aim;   \nIf you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\n    And treat those two impostors just the same;   \nIf you can bear to hear the truth you\u2019ve spoken\n    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\nOr watch the things you gave your life to, broken,\n    And stoop and build \u2019em up with worn-out tools:\n\nIf you can make one heap of all your winnings\n    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\nAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings\n    And never breathe a word about your loss;\nIf you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\n    To serve your turn long after they are gone,   \nAnd so hold on when there is nothing in you\n    Except the Will which says to them: \u2018Hold on!\u2019\n\nIf you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   \n    Or walk with Kings\u2014nor lose the common touch,\nIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\n    If all men count with you, but none too much;\nIf you can fill the unforgiving minute\n    With sixty seconds\u2019 worth of distance run,   \nYours is the Earth and everything that\u2019s in it,   \n    And\u2014which is more\u2014you\u2019ll be a man, my son.\n\nWriting music and poetry have been a part of my life for many years, along with science and martial arts. I've written a lot of songs, almost all of which no one has ever heard, including close friends. Me playing covers and reading this poem is a step toward it. My main passion is artificial intelligence (especially engineering of it into real-world systems) but guitar, piano, wrestling, jiu jitsu, and judo have helped me in that pursuit in fundamental ways that I hope to elucidate over time. If this is not your thing, please be patient and ignore it. But if you enjoy it, your support and love are always appreciated.\n\nConnect with on social media:\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/lexfridman\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman",

        "description": "This is a poem by Charles Bukowski titled Nirvana: \n\nNot much chance completely cut loose from purpose\nHe was a young man riding a bus\nThrough North Carolina on the way to somewhere\nAnd it began to snow\n\nAnd the bus stopped at a little caf\u00e9 in the hills\nAnd the passengers entered\nAnd he sat at the counter with the others\nAnd he ordered the food arrived\nAnd the meal was particularly good\nAnd the coffee\n\nThe waitress was unlike the women he had known\nShe was unaffected and there was a natural humor which came from her\nAnd the fry cook said crazy things\nAnd the dishwasher in back laughed a good clean pleasant laugh\n\nAnd the young man watched the snow through the window\nAnd he wanted to stay in that cafe forever\nThe curious feeling swam through him that everything was beautiful there\nAnd it would always stay beautiful there\n\nAnd then the bus driver told the passengers that it was time to board\nAnd the young man thought I'll just stay here\nI'll just stay here\nAnd then he rose and he followed the others into the bus\nHe found his seat and looked at the caf\u00e9 through the window\nAnd then the bus moved off down a curve downward out of the hills\n\nAnd the young man looked straight forward\nAnd he heard the other passengers speaking of other things\nOr they were reading or trying to sleep\nAnd they hadn't noticed the magic\nAnd the young man put his head to one side\nClosed his eyes and pretended to sleep\n\nThere was nothing else to do\nJust to listen to the sound of the engine\nAnd the sound of the tires\nIn the snow\n\nWriting music and poetry have been a part of my life for many years, along with science and martial arts. I've written a lot of songs, almost all of which no one has ever heard, including close friends. Me playing covers and reading this poem is a step toward it.

Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel\u00a0but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.\n\nSean Carroll is a theoretical physicist at Caltech and Santa Fe Institute specializing in quantum mechanics, arrow of time, cosmology, and gravitation. He is the author of several popular books and is a host of a great podcast called Mindscape.\n\nSubscribe to this YouTube channel or connect on:\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/lexfridman\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman\n- Medium: https://medium.com/@lexfridman\n- Support on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lexfridman",

You can watch the full conversation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNqqOLscOBY\n(more links below)\n\nPodcast full episodes playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4\n\nPodcasts clips playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeciFP3CBCIEElOJeitOr41\n\nPodcast website:\nhttps://lexfridman.com/ai\n\nPodcast on Apple Podcasts (iTunes):\nhttps://apple.co/2lwqZIr\n\nPodcast on Spotify:\nhttps://spoti.fi/2nEwCF8\n\nPodcast RSS:\nhttps://lexfridman.com/category/ai/feed/\n\nNote: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel\u00a0but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.\n\nSean Carroll is a theoretical physicist at Caltech and Santa Fe Institute specializing in quantum mechanics, arrow of time, cosmology, and gravitation.

I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel\u00a0but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow.

Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel\u00a0but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.\n\nSean Carroll is a theoretical physicist at Caltech and Santa Fe Institute specializing in quantum mechanics, arrow of time, cosmology, and gravitation.

As of this year, iRobot has sold more than 25 million robots to consumers, including the Roomba vacuum cleaning robot, the Braava floor mopping robot, and soon the Terra lawn mowing robot. 25 million robots successfully operating autonomously in people's homes to me is an incredible accomplishment of science, engineering, logistics, and all kinds of entrepreneurial innovation.\n\nSubscribe to this YouTube channel or connect on:\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/lexfridman\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman\n- Medium: https://medium.com/@lexfridman\n- Support on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lexfridman",

        "description": "Acoustic guitar cover of Simple Man by Lynyrd Skynyrd. Music is a solitary refuge for me so it took a lot for me to post Comfortably Numb last year (https://youtu.be/Khf-N2f8T78) and even more to sing on this one. Let me know if you have song requests for next year, and maybe before. Maybe one day I'll play an original song as well.\n\nThis song was recorded with Ableton Live. It has 3 guitar tracks. The video shows me playing one of the tracks. Next time, instead of layering, I'll just do it with a single track and a loop pedal like I would if I was playing it live. I'm new to recording music. The goal is to always be improving and enjoying the process, in all things, which I do.\n\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/lexfridman\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman\n- Medium: https://medium.com/@lexfridman\n- Support on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lexfridman",

        "description": "More information: http://lexfridman.com/driverfrustration\nPaper PDF: http://ijcai.org/Proceedings/16/Papers/195.pdf\n\nWe present a method for detecting driver frustration from both video and audio streams captured during the driver's interaction with an in-vehicle voice-based navigation system. The video is of the driver's face when the machine is speaking, and the audio is of the driver's voice when he or she is speaking. We analyze a dataset of 20 drivers that contains 596 audio epochs (audio clips, with duration from 1 sec to 15 sec) and 615 video epochs (video clips, with duration from 1 sec to 45 sec). The dataset is balanced across 2 age groups, 2 vehicle systems, and both genders. The model was subject-independently trained and tested using 4-fold cross-validation. We achieve an accuracy of 77.4% for detecting frustration from a single audio epoch and 81.2% for detecting frustration from a single video epoch. We then treat the video and audio epochs as a sequence of interactions and use decision fusion to characterize the trade-off between decision time and classification accuracy, which improved the prediction accuracy to 88.5% after 9 epochs.\n\nCONNECT:\n- If you enjoyed this video, please subscribe to this channel.\n- AI Podcast: https://lexfridman.com/ai/\n- Show your support: https://www.patreon.com/lexfridman\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/lexfridman\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman\n- Slack: https://deep-mit-slack.herokuapp.com",
